-Note: I was working more on the backend at this time as I was interested in learning Java Spring Boot.
-Figma file used: https://www.figma.com/design/jvcjzjCKw9YlhCNOIY1GPY/Horizon-Banking-App?node-id=0-1&t=4MTRhMsETMbX8x00-0 (This is owned by JSMastery, I used it for mostly for front-end design. Front-end logic and backend is all done by me. I used a different backend than they do and the logic for backend is completely my own.)

## Things I've learned on front-end: 
- Next: Next pages, Links, Router, client vs server side rendering, making sure to have components that require client side rendering to be its own component.
- Shadcn ui
- Tailwind cn function
- Better responsive design by having different media breakpoints, different padding, hiding sidebar at md and showing the mobile sidebar instead at below md.
- Zod form validation
- react-form-hook with shadcn
- Axios instances
